This `.gitignore` file includes rules for ignoring common unnecessary files in Python projects. You may need to customize it according to your project's specific needs. For example, if you're using a virtual environment, you might want to exclude the `venv/` directory. If you're using a different database, you might want to exclude its files as well.

To create a `.gitignore` file:

1. Open your text editor.
2. Copy the above content into the editor.
